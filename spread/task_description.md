# Spread - Task Description

## Overview

The Spread experiment simulates a multi-agent system where agents must spread out evenly across a space while maintaining connectivity. This challenge tests coordination and spatial reasoning abilities in a distributed system.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand distributed spatial coordination strategies
- Learn how to maintain connectivity while achieving optimal spacing
- Experience the challenges of balancing local and global objectives

## Instructions

1. Read through the task description and learning objectives carefully
2. Proceed to the configuration page to set up your experiment parameters
3. Configure the number of agents and their movement constraints
4. Run the experiment to observe how agents spread out while maintaining connectivity
