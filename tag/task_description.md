# Tag - Task Description

## Overview

The Tag experiment is a predator-prey environment. Good agents (green) are faster and receive a negative reward for being hit by adversaries (red) (-10 for each collision). Adversaries are slower and are rewarded for hitting good agents (+10 for each collision). Obstacles (large black circles) block the way. By default, there is 1 good agent, 3 adversaries and 2 obstacles.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand pursuit-evasion strategies in multi-agent systems
- Develop strategies for predicting and intercepting moving targets
- Experience the challenges of coordinating multiple chasers to catch evasive runners

## Instructions

1. Read through the task description and learning objectives carefully
2. Proceed to the configuration page to set up your experiment setup
3. Set the number and capabilities of both adversaries and good agents
4. Launch the simulation and observe how the agents interact in the environment
