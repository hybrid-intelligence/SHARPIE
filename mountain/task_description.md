# Mountain Car - Task Description

## Overview

The Mountain Car problem is a classic reinforcement learning challenge where you control a car that needs to climb a steep hill. The car's engine is not powerful enough to climb the hill directly, so you need to learn to build up momentum by moving back and forth.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of building momentum to overcome physical limitations
- Learn how to balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning
- Experience the challenges of solving problems with continuous state and action spaces

## Instructions

1. Read through the task description and learning objectives carefully
2. Proceed to the configuration page to set up your experiment parameters
3. Once configured, you'll be able to run the experiment and observe the car's behavior
4. Try different configurations to understand how they affect the learning process
